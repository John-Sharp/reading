Energy and Civilization: A History
==================================
Vaclav Smil, 2017

## 1 Energy and Society

* Energy only universal currency
* Evolution of human sociey history quest for controlling and converting energy
  with higher efficiencies
* Alfred Lotka: natural selection works to increase energy flux
* Wilhelm Ostwald (Nobel for Chemistry), 1912: free energy is the capital
  consumed by creatures of all kinds
* Certain that energy has an all-encompassing effect on society, but more
  contestible that there is deterministic link between energy use and cultural
  achievements. This book addresses that argument
* Knew how to release nuclear energy sooner (1943) than understood how
  photosynthesis worked (1950s)

### Flows, Stores, and Controls
* Box 1.1 Gravity and the habitability of Earth
    * There's a window, between frezing point of water and temperature that
      destabilises amino acids, in which life can exist
    * Atmosphere requires planet of a certain size
* Only 0.05% of incoming radiation captured by plants
* Animals are limited by how much nutrition they can acquire
* Yet humans multiply this through the use of tools
    * levers, fire, domesticisation of animals
* Things depend on how easy it is to capture certain types of energy
    * Trade winds to Caribbean, but Spaniards didn't discover Hawaii
* Analogy: a combination of gates had to be set up and activated in proper
  sequence 
    * education, law and order, economic capital

### Concepts and Measures
* First and second law of thermodynamics
* All organisms must be open system and have continuous inflow of energy
* Average adult, 8-11 MJ of energy a day: ~ 1kg of whole wheat bread (10 MJ)
* Average adult, power of 90 W(!)
* Energy density of food or fuel is also important
* Power density: cities used to need to draw on areas ~30x their size for fuel
* Box 1.6 Efficiency improvements and the Jevons paradox
    * Light-bulbs no more than 1% efficient, LEDs 15%
    * 1900 coal power stations 10% efficient, today's gas turbine plants 60%
      efficient
    * => 90-fold gain in turning energy in fossil fuels to light since 1900
    * William Stanley Jevons: efficency actually leads to more demand and use
* Energy returns: efficencies of production of foodstuffs
    * This shows that traditional farming methods are 'more efficient', because
      it doesn't distinguish between labour and fossil fuels
* Energy intensity: energy cost per mass for producing something 
* Energy return on investment: energy cost of acquiring energy

### Complexities and Caveats
* Things like cleanliness (sulphur content of coal for instance, much lower in
  Britain => dominance in maritime transport)
* Edible food, or nutrition content
* Net energy cost of human labour: that above the basal metabolic rate
* Muscles about 20% efficient (Archibald W. Hill)
* What about thinking, and the energy cost of developing society to enable that
  thinking?

## 2 Energy in Prehistory

* Earliest hominin remains: 4-5 million years ago
* Earliest homo sapiens bones: 190 000 years ago
* Only 10 000 years ago began sedentary existance based on domesticisation of
  plants and animals
* 3.5 million years ago hominin diets diverged from other apes: more
  13C-enriched foods (from C4 metabolism, showed that had more corn and grain)
* Bipedalism was our first evolutionary departure
* We are the only mammals who do this as ordinary way of walking
* Unstable, clumsy, leads to injuries and osteoporosis
* Why? Maybe lower energy expenditure, 75% less energy used than chimpanzees for
  walking
* After you're walking, hands freed for tool use, mouth for language
* Encephalization quotient, 2-3.5 for primates, humans > 6
* Human brain 20-25% of resting energy, 8-10% in primates, 3-5% in mammals
* This is offset by having smaller gut mass, and a better diet
* Earliest stone tools, 3.3M years ago (Lomekwi site, Kenya)
* Controlled fire, 790 000 years ago, fossil record suggests cooked food being
  eaten 1.9M years ago
* By Upper Paleolithic period (30 000 - 20 000 years ago) fire was in widespread
  use
* Led to physical changes (teeth, intestines) and behavioural (female-male bonds
  for guarding food)
* 100 - 150 kg of wood needed per person per year

### Foraging Societies
* Foraging population density ranged over three orders of magnitude
* Allometric equations predict ~5 50kg mammals/km^2, hunter-gatherers << 1
* Much higher by the sea
* Grasslands and open woodlands much better for foraging, despite lower energy
  density than tropical rainforest, because energy is more easily accessible
* Human bipedalism and better heat dissipation were things they could use to
  their advantage in hunting
* Bipedalism => humans can run at a variety of speeds
* Communal hunting brought the best rewards
* Humans so successful at hunting, did they bring around the disappearance of
  late Pleistocene megafauna?
* But energy not everything, one Botswanan tribe depend on mongongo nuts, while
  another don't touch them because they don't taste good
* In Amazonia one group ate less than half amount of animal energy and protein
  than another because they prefered taking hallucinogens

### Origins of Agriculture
* Multiple reasons
* Combination of population growth and environmental stress
    * Pleistocene -> Holocene saw warmer climate
    * 10 000 and 5 000 years ago saw cropping evolving indepently in > 7
      locations across 3 continents 
* Farming had social benefits and defensive and offensive ones
* Farming net energy returns often less than foraging
    * More energy input, but could support higher population densities and more
      reliable
* Recent research, Zeder 2011, Old World's most important region of
  agricultural origin upper reaches of Tigris and Euphrates
* Domestication of plants almost concurrently with this, about 10 000 years ago
  for Middle East, China, and South American. Similar for animals
* Evidence that demic diffusion (dispersing populations) responsible for
  agriculture's advance from looking at mitochondrial DNA sequences
* Early agriculture had very long rotation cycles
* Even moderately productive early agriculture could support population
  densities an order of magnitude higher than best foraging

## 3 Traditional Farming
* Evolution of agriculture continuing effort to raise land productivity to
  accomodate larger populations
* Only grains combine high yields with lots of carbohydrates and moderate
  amounts of proteins (5x energy density of tubers)
* Boserup: once limit of productivity reached can migrate, stabilise numbers or
  adopt more productive way of farming. Last one sometimes chosen reluctantly
* Net energy return may actually decline (since more energy expended doing
  intensive farming)
* Examples in history of delayed reclamation of marginal lands - medieval
  europe saw waves of peasants moving to open up new farmland east. China with
  Manchuria only during 18th century
* In most regions farming progressed from extensive to intensive cultivation
  (i.e. figuring out ways to keep soil fertile), while the inputs, human and
  animal muscles remained unchanged for millenia
* Much more inputs needed for digging of wells and irrigation systems, making
  of farm equipment etc
* Americas exception to rule that animals became more important. Neither
  mesoamerican or Incan farmers had draft animals
* Also improvements that didn't require higher energy inputs: use of
  nitrogen-fixing crops periodically, new crop varieties, irrigation devices
* Society became more organised, long-term planning, investment, and
  specialised skills
* Stimulated use of wind and water as energy sources
* Traditional farming could support population densities orders of magnitude
  higher than foraging societies, and led to an energy surplus that allowed
  non-farming activities

### Commonalities and Peculiarities
* Some practices came early and diffused rapidly (sickle and flail), while
  others remained localised but then suddenly diffused and improved (iron
  moldboard plow, seed drill)

### Field Work
* From Upper Paleolithic to twentieth century, you can observe a decrease in
  bending strength of leg bones as population becomes increasingly sedentary
* Weakening stopped about two millenia ago
* Farming machines only began to diffuse in early modern era (1500-1800)
* Sequence of developments always starts with ploughing
* For centuries ploughs were symmetrical until moldboards and in first century
  the Han Chinese invention of metal moldboard
* Harrows developed to replace hoeing
* Hand seeding remained common in Europe until nineteenth century, despite seed
  drills being used as early 1300BCE in mesopotamia

### The Dominance of Grains
* Water content of tubers too high for long-term storage
* Low in protein (20% that of cereals)
* Grains dominate because of high energy density, and storage properties
* Mix of grains and legumes/tubers can provide all amino acids

### Cropping Cycles
* Rice has much higher labour requirements than wheat cultivation
* Wheat producing areas had lots of free time for construction work
* Harvesting times required a lot of labour

### Routes to Intensification
* Three essential advances: animal labour, irrigation and fertilisation, and
  crop-rotation
* They are linked by mutually reinforcing feedback loops

### Draft Animals
* Draft potential could only be transalted into effective performance with
  proper harnesses
* Before that smaller animals' application of force was closer to parallel
* Collar harness made horses into best working animals (a Chinese invention)
* But this was not revolutionary, since they ate grain and needed shoeing (both
  expensive)
* Really good at ploughing, but also at lifting water, milling
* In China and India, tended to prefer cattle as they did not compete for crop
  harvests

### Irrigation
* Expensive task, hectare of wheat can be cut in 8 hours, but 3 months to lift
  half its water
* Building irrigation canals required well-established central governments

### Fertlization
* Macronutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
* Nitrogen is the most important to replenish
* Human and animal wastes used as fertiliser
* Incas used guano, it used too be imported to the US and England
* Also legumes were used: 1750-1880 standard rotations used: 'the Agricutural
  Revolution'

### Crop Diversity
* Main advantage of multicropping is ability to support larger populations from
  same amount of land (energy cost is higher)

### Persistence and Innovation
### Ancient Egypt
* Egypt was Rome's greatest grain supplier
* Even as late as 1820 it only cultivated half as much land as it did during
  Roman times

### China
